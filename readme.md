  This project showcases five unique hero sections I designed for different brand concepts. As someone still learning, my goal was to explore creative and engaging web design while improving my skills in layout, interactivity, and branding. Each section includes key elements like animated text, styled buttons, product displays, and responsive features. I used HTML and CSS to build structure and design, and I’m starting to apply JavaScript for interactive elements like carts and filters. Overall, this project reflects my progress and ongoing growth in front-end development, especially as I continue learning JavaScript.

## Overview

  This project showcases five unique hero sections I designed for different brand concepts. As someone still learning, my goal was to explore creative and engaging web design while improving my skills in layout, interactivity, and branding. Each section includes key elements like animated text, styled buttons, product displays, and responsive features. I used HTML and CSS to build structure and design, and I’m starting to apply JavaScript for interactive elements like carts and filters. Overall, this project reflects my progress and ongoing growth in front-end development, especially as I continue learning JavaScript.

### Key Components
- MultiPage Website

### Technology

![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=white)

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

└─ assets
|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
|   └─ js
|       └─ script.js
└─ pages

```
